# Mlp-form-Scratch

This project implements mlp from scratch for in depth understanding of machine learning and their evaluation using serveral parameters including:
- **Confusion Matrix** : implemented from scratch
- **Accuracy**: implemented from scratch
- **Precision** : implemented from scratch
- **Recall**: implemented from scratch
- **F1-Score**: implemented from scratch
- **Roc Curve**: built in

The model has been testing on serveral datasets including:
- **Iris**
- **Minsit** 
- **Diabetes** (binary classifier)
- **Flowers** (image dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition.)
